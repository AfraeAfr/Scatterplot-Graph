# Scatterplot-Graph
This project is to build an interactive scatterplot graph visualization application that uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3.js library. 

The D3.js library will be used to create the scatterplot and its axes, while it will be generating ticks automatically to align properly the graph's elements. While not departing from these requirements, the project also encourages extra personal touches with respect to styling and interactivity to further embellish the scatterplot graph both in looks and usability.
